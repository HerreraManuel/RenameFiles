# RenameFiles
I had a collection of Pokemon images labelled as:
```python
0001.png
0002.png
.
.
.
0151.png
```
I wanted rename the files to the appropriate Pokemon names based on their number but I did not want to do it manually. So I used my database that contained the columns id and name to match the numbers and name the file to the correct pokemon name.

Now we have:
```
bulbasaur.png
ivysaur.png
.
.
.
mew.png
```
My degree was finally put into good use.
